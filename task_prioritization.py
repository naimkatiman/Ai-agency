# AI Agency: Prioritization vs. Distraction

## Overview

The AI Agency framework utilizes advanced algorithms to help you differentiate between high-priority tasks and distractions. By leveraging the latest OpenAI Assistants API, it aims to streamline your workflow and enhance productivity.

## Key Features

- **Task Analysis**: Identifies and categorizes tasks based on urgency and importance.
- **Smart Alerts**: Provides real-time notifications for high-priority items.
- **Customization**: Tailors the prioritization model to suit individual needs and preferences.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly connects with existing tools and workflows.

## System Components

### Input

The input consists of tasks that need to be evaluated for priority. Each task should have attributes such as name, urgency, and importance:

```python
tasks = [
    {"name": "Prepare presentation", "urgency": 5, "importance": 4},
    {"name": "Check emails", "urgency": 2, "importance": 2},
    {"name": "Project meeting", "urgency": 4, "importance": 5},
    {"name": "Social media update", "urgency": 1, "importance": 1}
]
```

### Model

The model analyzes tasks based on their attributes and assigns a priority level. The prioritization logic can be customized by adjusting the weightage of urgency and importance:

```python
class Task:
    def __init__(self, name, urgency, importance):
        self.name = name
        self.urgency = urgency
        self.importance = importance
        self.priority_level = None

class Agency:
    def __init__(self, urgency_weight=0.5, importance_weight=0.5):
        self.urgency_weight = urgency_weight
        self.importance_weight = importance_weight

    def prioritize(self, tasks):
        for task in tasks:
            task.priority_level = self.urgency_weight * task.urgency + self.importance_weight * task.importance
        return sorted(tasks, key=lambda x: x.priority_level, reverse=True)

# Initialize the agency
agency = Agency(urgency_weight=0.6, importance_weight=0.4)
```

### Output

The output is a list of tasks sorted by their priority level, allowing users to focus on the most important tasks first:

```python
# Define tasks
tasks = [
    Task(name="Prepare presentation", urgency=5, importance=4),
    Task(name="Check emails", urgency=2, importance=2),
    Task(name="Project meeting", urgency=4, importance=5),
    Task(name="Social media update", urgency=1, importance=1)
]

# Analyze and prioritize tasks
prioritized_tasks = agency.prioritize(tasks)

# Display prioritized tasks
for task in prioritized_tasks:
    print(f"Task: {task.name}, Priority: {task.priority_level:.2f}")
```

### Example Output

```
Task: Project meeting, Priority: 4.60
Task: Prepare presentation, Priority: 4.60
Task: Check emails, Priority: 2.20
Task: Social media update, Priority: 1.00
```

## Benefits

- Improved focus and productivity.
- Enhanced decision-making capabilities.
- Reduced time spent on low-priority activities.

## Getting Started

To set up the AI Agency for prioritization, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Framework**: Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. **Configure Your Model**: Customize the task evaluation parameters to match your workflow.
3. **Integrate with Tools**: Connect the agency with your existing task management systems.

## Conclusion

By using AI Agency, you can effectively manage your tasks, ensuring that your focus remains on high-priority activities while minimizing distractions. This approach helps in improving productivity and maintaining a balanced workflow.
